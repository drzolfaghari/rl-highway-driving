# RL Highway Driving ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

This project implements **Reinforcement Learning algorithms (DQN & PPO)**
for autonomous driving tasks using the `highway-env` environment.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `train/train_dqn.py` â†’ Train & evaluate DQN
- `train/train_ppo.py` â†’ Train & evaluate PPO
- `utils/logger.py` â†’ Save rewards, episode length, collisions, and actions to CSV
- `utils/plotter.py` â†’ Plot results (reward curves, episode length, collisions, action distribution)
- `logs/` â†’ Training logs and CSV files
- `videos/` â†’ Rendered videos of trained models

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train/train_dqn.py
python train/train_ppo.py
